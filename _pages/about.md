My name's Brandon Skerritt.
To me, computer science is the beautiful art of solving complex problems with logical and abstract solutions. I have been problem solving since I was a child and programming since I was 11.

I have been selected by SEO London, an organisation that trains and connections exceptional people from poor backgrounds to succeed.

I have won at 2 hackathons, HackNotts 2016; my first hackathon, and Hack Sheffield 3.0.
