# My Website
This is a mess because half of it is Minimal Mistakes theme in Jekyll and half is raw html, css and Javascript.

So basically I needed Jekyll as a blogging service and I really liked the minimal mistakes theme. I export all my blog posts to Medium but I needed Jekyll because writing my posts in markdown is so much fun. 

But at the same time I wanted a landing page that looks nice so I hand built a landing page in HTML / CSS / Javascript. So half of the website is a Jekyll blog and the other half is a landing page. Users shouldn't be able to fimd the blog as it contains my drafts etc so theres no links to it on the landing page.
