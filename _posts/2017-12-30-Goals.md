2017, you have been good to me. Kind, loving and horrible all at the same time. Let's take a look back.

# January 2017

January, the month that started it all. I was studying my HNC in Computing and Systems development whilest taking GCSE maths. I had just been elected to be the *only* Students Union officer. It was a busy month. I visited Canterbury, alot. I was still living back home, depressed of home life but my college life was happy.

# February

I went to Nottingham via St Pancras to see Bethany in this month, and then I went to Liverpool for the first time.

The hustle and bustle of city life, it's what i've always wanted and I found it here.
Whilest at Liverpool amongst visiting the university I was also working on a website for a hotel

A walk through my little seaside town. In the words of Turner:
>Margate has the lovliest skies in the whole of Europe

I went to London in this month.

There were memorial flowers everywhere to mark the tragic loss of life on this bridge the day before.

I took my dad to Camden and whilest rushing through the hidden elusive underground markets I quickly snapped this photo, one of my favourites from 2017.

What's this? London again? Twice in a month? Yes!
This time we went on a field trip with my college to EGX rezzed, a gaming convention!
![Docks](https://photos.app.goo.gl/neL2XqPpOANhrUWx1)
Tobacco docks!
Eventually we got bored of the convention, so we went for a walk around London...
