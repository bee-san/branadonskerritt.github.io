2017, you have been good to me. Kind, loving and horrible all at the same time. Let's take a look back.

# January 2017

January, the month that started it all. I was studying my HNC in Computing and Systems development whilest taking GCSE maths. I had just been elected to be the *only* Students Union officer. It was a busy month. I visited Canterbury, alot. I was still living back home, depressed of home life but my college life was happy.

# February

I went to Nottingham via St Pancras to see Bethany in this month, and then I went to Liverpool for the first time.

The hustle and bustle of city life, it's what i've always wanted and I found it here.
Whilest at Liverpool amongst visiting the university I was also working on a website for a hotel

I went to London in this month.

What's this? London again? Twice in a month? Yes!
This time we went on a field trip with my college to EGX rezzed, a gaming convention!

Eventually we got bored of the convention, so we went for a walk around London...
