# What is a Binomial Coefficient?

First, let's start with a binomial.
A binomial is a _polynomial_ with two terms typically in the format \\( (x + y) \\).

A binomial coefficient is raising a binomial to the power of n, like so \\( (x + y)^n \\)

# Binomial Therom

The Binomial Therom is the expected method to use for finding binomial coefficients because it is how a computer would compute it.
The therom is as follows:
