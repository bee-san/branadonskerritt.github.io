# A look back on 2017 goals
These were my new-years resolutions in December of 2016 for 2017:
* To read 52 books this year
    Very close, 44 :)
    
* To go for a run at least 200 / 365 days
    76 days. College got in the way but I've got a trick up my sleeve for this.

* To earn a distinction in my current course
    100% in every assignment :)

* To get an A in GCSE maths
    Got a B, was off by 2 marks!! 2 MARKS!!!!! sooo close!!

* To attend as many hackathons and BCS events as possible
    Attended 1 online BCS event, maybe like 5 hackathons

* Go somewhere really cool this summer
    I went to Germany!!!

* Write more blog posts
    Oh boy, I wrote 25 blog posts this year! So many!

* Learn alot of German
    Can't understand Megan and can barely order a coffee

* Make the student experience the best It can be
    In the end of the academic year of 2016, the student experience from the students union was under a 30% satisfaction rating (students said that they didn't like the students union). By the time I finished, EVERY SINGLE STATISTIC TO DO WITH THE STUDENTS UNION WENT UP BY 70 - 80%!! Not only that, but I was the *only* SU officer compared to 10 previous officers!

* Get a job
    I actually did, alot actually. But I gave them all up to study.

* Dress better
    Hola @ UO for saving my horrible dress sense <3 :) 

* Start saving better
    Hey!! I did this too!! I've saved over 11k this year!!

* Contribute more to the technological community
    Technical blog posts and contributing to open source, I did this too!!!

* Start Meditate
    I do this all the time (mindfullness)

* Write a business plan
    I did this, but the business didn't take off. Oh well, lessons learned.

* Pass my driving test
    Decided I don't want to drive.

# Goals for 2018

## Commit to #100DaysofHealth
This is a challenge started by Alex, a fellow coder. Here are the rules
For the next 100 Days:

    I will be focused on improving my health in various ways every day.
    I will tweet an update daily with the hashtags: #100DaysOfHealth #100DaysOfX and a day on which I am on, and with my thoughts/feelings on that day
    I will encourage at least 2 other people in the challenge daily
    I will work out at least 3 times a week (*whatever a workout means for you)
    I will allow myself a little square of chocolate daily, if I want it
    I will make an effort to buy healthy food (groceries) and to cook at home as much as I can.
    I will NOT eat any junk food (e.g. chips, ice-cream, instant noodles, etc.)
    I will NOT weigh myself during the challenge. It’s one of the most important rules because it switches focus from a results-oriented to a process-oriented one. Also it helps us appreciate and love our bodies and not to diminish our worth based on a number.
    I will NOT drink sugary drinks as they are often a hidden source of an enormous amount of sugar we get daily – which means: soda (pop), juices, sweet coffee/tea drinks.
    Rules are rules, but if one day I have a huge craving for some specific type of food, I will allow myself to eat it. The catch is that it will be a small amount.

It's almost impossible to achieve a goal without stating *why* you want it. So here's my whys:
* To look better
* To feel healthier
* To be able to pull all nighters easier
* Lose weight (pretty cliche)
* To enjoy life more

Some of the ways I will do this are:
* Hike more
* Karate
* Maybe start climbing
* Running
* Weightlifting

It's important to only set one habit to obsess yourself over, since you can't juggle many plates. So this will be my main priority for the first 100 days. Other things I'll achieve are

## Wisdom teeth
Finally get rid of my wisdom teeth. Why? Because they hurt and it sucks that I'm so afraid to go through with it.

## Code more
Seriously, I code so little I've almost forgotten how to code. I need to code more. Whether it be Java or not. Why? I want to be a really sucessful entrepeuner. In order to do that I need to code. It's the easiest way to make a startup, is to code.

## Complete YCombinator School
If I get accecpted, I will complete all 10 weeks of Ycombinator school. Why? Because I want to make a startup, and you can't make a startup without knowing Ycombinator exists. There online (free) school will help me alot in the future, so I may as well do it now.

## Secure an internship
Secure that internship. You want it? You want it because it's your dream job at your dream place, that they only accecpt 3 people a year? You work for it. You want it? Do it fast and work hard. Nothing is going to be given to you for free. Just. Do. It.

## Wake up earlier
I want to wake up earlier. Jocko said that:
> By waking up at 4:30am, you are forced to be motivated and achieve your goals. What else are you going to do? You have to work. If you write out what you want to do the night before and go to bed, wake up at 4:30am. Work out first thing. Then do those things you have chosen to do. When it comes time other people wake up, 7, 9, 11am you will be done for the day. What can you do? Anything you want.
It's going to be incredibly hard, but I'm going to do it as part of my #100daysofhealth

## Network more
I need to network more. You want to be a crazy sucessful startup founder? 90% of startups fail in the first year. 99% fail in 5 years. There are hundreds of thousands of startups every year and almost every single one fails. You want to make it in the world? You need to network. Attend more networking events.

## Continue writing
My classmates are extremely satisfied with my blogposts. I want to create better, nicer blog posts to help them and to help myself study.

## Do something absolutely insane this summer
Go to Africa, alone. Do something literally everyone will tell you is insane. It's how you grow. 

## Go completely vegan
Meat, diary, animal products make me feel very ill. It's important to have a clean mindset and a good heart. You need to do this.

## Read more
No sucessful person doesn't read. Every single person you know who is successful reads, alot. 

The books I will read this year are:
* How to Win friends and influence people
It's a classic, I've read this twice already. Let's go for a fourth.
* Ted talks
It's important to know how to give seminars, this is vital.
* Smart cities
You got into CS because you loved the idea of smart cities, this book is perfect for you.
* On anarchism
Chomsky's writing is quintessential to the idea of "knowledge", read this book to fully understand an anarchists mindset.
* Homo Deus
It's about the future and technology. You need to read this.
* The China Study
Not just the first 100 pages, the entire book.
* Hacking secret ciphers with python edition 2
The first book got you into Python, this one will be just as good.

## Listen to more podcasts

Podcasts are amazing. The most amazing people in the world who are everything you want to become are creating podcasts about how to do it. Why don't you listen to more? Commit to listen to at least 1 more podcast every week.

## Slow down once in a while
>Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. 
Feris Bueler's Day Off

## Get a first in your first year of university
This is not a choice. You CANNOT get anything less than a first. You ABSOLUTELY must have a first. I know everyone wants a first, but you NEED a first. Even if it kills your social life, you need this way more than anyone else. DO NOT GIVE UP, ever.

## Disicpline yourself.
Discipline Equals Freedom. Free yourself.

## Review this.
Review this every single month to make sure you keep your goals on track.

## Practice How to win friends and influence people
Actively try to make this a part of your life.

# Long term goals
