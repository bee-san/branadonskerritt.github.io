# Question 1 

Let A = {2, 3} and B = {a, b, c}. List the elements of A × B.

To do this you need to make ordered pairs whereby the first element is the first element of set A and the second element is every element in set B.

{(2,a), (2,b), (2,c), (3,a), (3,b), (3,c)}

# Question 2

```Let |A| = m and |B| = n. What is the cardinality of the set A × B?```

The cardinality is how many elements are in the set, represented by |A|. Count how many elements are in set A and B and then times them.

2 * 3 = 6

# Question 3

List the set of ordered pairs of the relation R represented by the following digraph (diagraph in pdf)

```
{(1,2)
(2,1),(2,2)
(3,3)
(4,2),(4,5)
(5,1)}
```

Remember that some arrows are _bi-directional_ or just 1 direction or just repeats onto itself.

# Question 4

## Part A

Let A = {a, b, c}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4} and C = {3, 4, 5}.
List the set of ordered pairs of the relation R between A and B represented by the following
matrix.

Matrix =

F | T | T | T
--- | --- | --- | ---
F | F | T | T
F | F | T | T


Okay, so we know it's a relation between A and B, so the matrix will look something like

 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
--- | --- | --- | ---
a |
b |
c |

Then we will it in with the truth values from above

 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
--- | --- | --- | ---
a | F | T | T | T
b | F | F | T | T
c | F | F | T | T

Now we simply pull out the ordered pairs that appear as true in the matrix

```
{(a,2),(a,3),(a,4)
(b,3),(b,4)
(c,3),(c,4)}
```

## Part B

Let S ⊆ B × C be given by
S = {(x, y) | x < y}.
List the set of ordered pairs in the inverse relation S−1 of S.
B = {1, 2, 3, 4} and C = {3, 4, 5}.
**maybe correct**
```
(1,3),(1,4),(1,5)
(2,3),(2,4),(2,5)
(3,4),(3,5)
(4,5)
```

## Part C
Compute the matrix representation of S ◦ R


o R=  1,  2,  3,  4,  5
S 1,  F,  F,  T,  T,  T
  2,  F,  T,  F,  T,  T
  3,  F,  F,  F,  T,  T   = Matrix
  4,  F,  F,  F,  F,  T
  5,  F,  F,  F,  F,  F
  
  
# Question 5
Let T = {(2, 3),(1, 2),(3, 1)}. List the set of ordered pairs in the transitive closure of T
*skipped*

# Question 6

Which of the following sentences are propositions?

(1) A banana is larger than its skin
(2) London is the capital of Paris
(3) Answer this question
(4) 2 + 3 = 5
(5) 5 + 7 = 10

Question 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all propositional statements as they have a true or false value.
