# What is a number system?

A number system is a system of numbers used to represent an amount of objects. In the English speaking world, we use a number system called base 10. We have 10 numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and when we want to count past 9 we add a 1 and 0 together to make 10, and then we repeat.

But we can have as many numbers as we want, we can have 0 through to 8 or 0 through to 1, which is what we're going to talk about here.

# What is binary?

Binary is a number system which only has 2 numbers, 0 and 1. We can count any number in binary. To make binary more readable, here is a quick translation of binary numbers into base 10 (decimal) numbers.

0 | 1 | 10 | 11 | 100
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4

0 is equal to 0, and 1 is equal to 1. To make the number 2, we write "10" because it's physically impossible to write anything > 1, we have to start over in a new column. Much like how we cannot write 11 as a single number (unless you count in base systems more than 10).

Binary is often used in logic, 0 represents False of Off and 1 represents True or On.
